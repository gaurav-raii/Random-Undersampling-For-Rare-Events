# Random-Undersampling-For-Rare-Events
* Random Under sampling technique was used to model an event( Car crash insurance claim) having skewed distribution of positive and negative classes.
* Modeling rare events where the observations in the minority class is less than 10% of the total observations is challenging because the usual approach for classification problems tend to ignore the minority event. It will classify all observations to the majority class and still will achieve a very high accuracy.
* An effective approach to counter this specific shortcoming of the traditional methods is to use Random Under Sampling(RUS). Randomly Undersampling the negative class(majority class) to create training data with comparable negative and positive examples gave a huge boost to the accuracy of the classifiers.
