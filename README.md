# Random-Undersampling-For-Rare-Events
This Project demonstrates the use of random Under sampling technique to model rare events where the observations in the minority class is less than 10% of the total observations.
Modeling rare events is challenging because the usual approach for classification problems tend to ignore the minority event. It will classify all observations to the majority class and still will achieve a very high accuracy.
An effective approach to counter the shortcoming of the traditional methods is to use Random Under Sampling(RUS) or Random Over Sampling(ROS).
I am using RUS here in this project.
